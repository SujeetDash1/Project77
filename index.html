        <p> Hi, I'm Sohan Dash and I'm creating this console web app of where I am inviting everyone to my Graduation Party for this Summer in which
            they should have fun Coding. Coding brings the world of knowledge for people because they can show and truly understand why we build apps and games.
            Their Academics can lead to good Schools and start early as freshmen in High School and then through College for Computer Coding. Coding enhances Tech-Powered Solutions in which
            is really helpful for their jobs. MIT Engineering Courses often has some of the most best languages in the world to solve network problems.
            Our outputs can determine whether we have jobs and futurized companies to help each other and the world. My Essay:
            Why should everyone go and celebrate Graduation Party? Graduation Party is needed because people can use and socialize that helps them with their 
            jobs and future. Graduation Party offers foods, drinks and beverages to enjoy and relax their whole summer. For example,
            Juice and Soda is for fun for drinking and having fun their whole lives. Graduation Party also lets students plan what are they going to do next summer for Coding.
            For instance, Environmental Science, AP Human Geography and Telecommunications are these special tools for education.
            Computers bring robot space stations which are used in Celebrations for students. In addition, Research for students are an also important
            part of their life for better changes for goals. So, within on my behalf, Graduation Parties are required for students because once they graduate High School, they'll
            miss life, so that is why they need a lot of socializing to keep themselves happy before goodbyes and achieve their own Academics.
            Sincerely, Sohan Dash
